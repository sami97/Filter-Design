# 1. Generation of white noise with Gaussian distribution #
Generate the white noise with the Gaussian distribution using the following code:\
>x = 5 * randn([1,4096]);\
- Make a plot of the white noise.\
Plot the first 50 samples (discrete-time signal style) using the MATLAB function “stem()”.\
- Use fft() to compute DFT coefficients, and plot and examine the magnitude spectrum of the signal x(n) assuming the sampling rate is 8000 Hz. Label and print your graph.\
- Listen to the generated signal using the sampling rate of 8000Hz.
